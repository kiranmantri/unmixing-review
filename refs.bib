  abstract  = {The recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing technology allow the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of spectral wavelengths for each image pixel. This rich spectral information of the hyperspectral data makes it possible to discriminate different physical substances, leading to a potentially more accurate classification and thus opening the door to numerous new applications. Throughout the history of remote sensing research, numerous methods for hyperspectral image analysis have been presented. Depending on the spatial resolution of the images, specific mathematical models must be designed to effectively analyze the imagery. Some of these models operate at a sub-pixel level, trying to decompose a mixed spectral signature into its pure constituents, while others operate at a pixel or even object level, seeking to assign unique labels to every pixel or object in the scene. The spectral mixing of the measurements and the high dimensionality of the data are some of the challenging features of hyperspectral imagery. This chapter presents an overview of unmixing and classification methods, intended to address these challenges for accurate hyperspectral data analysis.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of hyperspectral data sets requires the determination of certain basis spectra called 'end-members.' Once these spectra are found, the image cube can be 'unmixed' into the fractional abundance of each material in each pixel. There exist several techniques for accomplishing the determination of the end-members, most of which involve the intervention of a trained geologist. Often these-end-members are assumed to be present in the image, in the form of pure, or unmixed, pixels. In this paper a method based upon the geometry of convex sets is proposed to find a unique set of purest pixels in an image. The technique is based on the fact that in N spectral dimensions, the N-volume contained by a simplex formed of the purest pixels is larger than any other volume formed from any other combination of pixels. The algorithm works by 'inflating' a simplex inside the data, beginning with a random set of pixels. For each pixel and each end-member, the end-member is replaced with the spectrum of the pixel and the volume is recalculated. If it increases, the spectrum of the new pixel replaces that end-member. This procedure is repeated until no more replacements are done. This algorithm successfully derives end-members in a synthetic data set, and appears robust with less than perfect data. Spectral end-members have been extracted for the AVIRIS Cuprite data set which closely match reference spectra, and resulting abundance maps match published mineral maps.},
